<dt><h3><b><li>Flexibility:Easily create/modify workflow patterns that suit your needs</li></b></h3></dt>

<p>Choosing a workflow system that’s easy to adapt to your specific needs is the first step 
towards workflow management success. Your workflow management app should help you standardize
 and manage your processes without constraining them.</p>

  <dt><h3><b><li>Transparency:Easily find information that you need,when you need it</li></b></h3></dt>
  <div >Workflow systems, by definition, exist to help you manage your workflows better and more 
  efficiently. Therefore, they’re expected to help people find relevant information,  such as task status, easily and without too much effort.</i> </div>
  <dt><h3><b><li>Access control:Different people have different access needs</li></b></h3></dt>
  <div  >Transparency is a must-have for every workflow system.That doesn’t mean everyone should be able to access everything, though. It also 
  doesn’t mean that each user in your company should be able to view and edit workflows in which they’re not involved.</div>
  <dt><h3><b><li>Cloud based:Easy access,anywhere,anytime</li></b></h3></dt>
  <div  >Cloud-based workflow systems are usually flexible, cost-effective and easily scalable. Also, they offer users the possibility of working from many devices – what can come in handy
  when dealing with a field sales team, for example.</div>
  <dt><h3><b><li>Built-in team communications</li></b></h3></dt>
  <div  >A good workflow app must support communications around tasks right where work is happening.
  Employees should be able to comment on tasks and processes,ask questions, mention their co-workers,
  attach files, documents and images, etc.</div>
